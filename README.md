This repo is a walk through to show you how I scraped play by play data from bball ref for NBA. I use this data to write comedic statistical sports columns on my blog statholesports.com. You can follow me on twitter @statholesports for latest post notifications.

If you just want the data - see "Quick File Download - Skip the Scrape!" and paste whatever seasons of pbp you want in R and it will pull it from my repo. 

To lessen the burden of scraping on bbref, I recommend you just use the aforementioned process to get the data. The scrape walk through (pbp_season_scrape) is moreso for learning and figuring out how to adapt to similar tables from bbref or other sports ref sites you might be interested in. 

After the scraping, the "Feature Engineer Script" is all the post scrape data manipulation to create the final product. This should all be perfomred in the "Quick File Download - Skip the Scrape!" page as well so no need to do anything other than download these.

I have a walk through in video form as well on YouTube that can be seen here (INSERT WHEN DONE)
